- Tamarind paste - 1 tsp or a little more, adjust to taste
- Asafoetida - a little, adjust to taste. A little goes a long way
- Roasted gram(பொட்டுக்கடலை ) - like a half a hand or more. The more you add, thicker your curry will be

## Steps
### Fry the okra
- Fry the okra until all the stickiness or almost all of it is gone
- Don't burn them, keep it on medium heat and adding a bit of salt to extract moisture helps
### Make the masala base
- Fry the onions/shallots in oil until almost golden
- Add in red chillies, coriander seeds, cumin, curry leaves and fry them until fragrant
- Make space in the middle and fry the fenugreek seeds in the oil until fragrant.
*NOTE* If you over fry them they tend to become bitter and if you under fry them they have a raw aroma to them. You will know it done if its pinkish-brown. 
- Remove from heat and add in asafoetida, coconut, turmeric, tamarind paste, roasted gram and coconut. Mix them in the tava's residual heat
- Grind all of this into a paste
### Temper and bring it together
- Again, don't burn it, use medium heat
- Add mustard seeds, wait for it to splutter
- Add in curry leaves
- Lower the heat and add in the ground masala, let it simmer for a minute
- Add in the fried okra
